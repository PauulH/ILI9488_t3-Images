**I got this idea from By Frank BÃ¶sing's code.**

There are 2 versions. 
the first on stores the images in microcontroller memory. The other stores the images on an SD card.
If using the non SD card version, you probably wont be able to store more than 1 image in memory at a time.
For the SD card version, I used the adafruit SD card reader over SPI.
Store the images on the SD card in the "pics" folder.

I used the Teensy 4.0. Note that I have not initialised serial comms so you might need to do that if using an arduino or other micro.
I overclocked the 4.0 to 720mHz and get pretty impressive results. The Teensy 4.0 writes a 300kB file to the TFT screen in around 60ms.

I have pushed the SPI clock speed to the limit. You will need to reduce "tft.begin(70000000);" if using a slower microcontroller. 
"const size_t READ_CHUNK_SIZE = 100000;" buffer size might need to be adjusted depending on microcontroller.

Please get in touch if you know how to make this code run faster. I am sure there is alot of optimization possible.
